## Comparing MCP with RAG
**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a conceptual approach to managing and providing context (like user preferences, instructions, or session history) to large language models. By maintaining and updating this context, MCP enables models to deliver more personalized, consistent, and task-aware responses.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that combines the power of language models with external knowledge retrieval. Instead of relying only on the modelâ€™s internal data, RAG dynamically pulls in relevant documents or facts from external sources and then generates a more accurate, informed answer.
