## Real World Security Breaches

### 1.Broken acess control
a security vulnerability where a system or application fails to properly enforce access restrictions, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions or access resources they shouldn't have. This can result in data breaches, privilege escalation, and other malicious activities. 
**Examples:**
- Changing URL parameters to access other users' accounts.
- Accessing admin pages without proper permissions.

### 2.Cryptographic Failures
Cryptographic failures happen when sensitive data (like passwords, credit card numbers, or health info) isnâ€™t properly protected during storage or transfer.
**Examples**
- Not using HTTPS, allowing attackers to steal data on public networks.
- Storing passwords with weak or no hashing (e.g., unsalted hashes or MD5).
- Using outdated or weak encryption algorithms.
