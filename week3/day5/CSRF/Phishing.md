##  Phishing

Phishing is one of the most common cyber attack techniques used by scammers and attackers, targeting individuals and organizations indiscriminately.

In many cases, phishing is the **initial attack vector** used to gain access to a company's infrastructure, before performing further attacks on the network. Even though many automated tools exist today to combat phishing, it remains one of the most prolific attack vectors.

##  Phishing as a Social Engineering Attack

Phishing is a subset of **social engineering** â€” an attack that exploits humans rather than technical vulnerabilities.

Traditionally, phishing meant **fraudulent emails**, but today it also includes:

- **Smishing**: phishing via SMS
- **Vishing**: phishing via voice calls

Phishing messages usually create a **false sense of urgency**, tricking victims into clicking a malicious link that leads to an attacker-controlled web page. Victims are then asked to enter sensitive information such as login credentials or credit card details, or they may unknowingly install malware.
