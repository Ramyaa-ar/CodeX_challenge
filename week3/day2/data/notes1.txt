LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications that use large language models (LLMs). It allows developers to easily integrate language models with external data sources and build custom workflows. LangChain supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling LLMs to answer questions based on specific private documents.
